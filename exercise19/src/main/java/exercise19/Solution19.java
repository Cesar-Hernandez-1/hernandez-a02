/*
 *  Pseudocode:
 *  Prompt user to enter their height in inches
 *
 *  Check if input entered is a numeric value, if not ask user to enter a
 *      numeric value.
 *
 *  Prompt user to enter their weight in pounds.
 *
 *  Check if input entered is a numeric value, if not ask user to enter a
 *      numeric value.
 *
 *  Calculate BMI by the formula: bmi = (weight / (height Ã— height)) * 703
 *
 *  Output user BMI. If user BMI is under 18.5 tell the user they are underweight and
 *      suggest they see their doctor. If their BMI is above 25, tell user they
 *      are overweight and tell them to see their doctor. If the BMI is between 18.5 and 25
 *      tell user they are within the ideal weight range.
